# Events System Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What We've Built

A complete events management system for your dashboard that allows users to:

- View events on an interactive calendar
- Add new events with title, date, time, and description
- See event details when clicking on calendar dates
- Store all events in MySQL database
- Manage events through a RESTful API

## 🏗️ Backend Implementation

### Database Schema

- **Table**: `events`
- **Fields**: `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `event_date`, `event_time`, `description`, `created_at`
- **Relationships**: Foreign key to `users` table

### API Endpoints

1. **GET** `/api/events/:userId` - Retrieve user's events
2. **POST** `/api/events` - Create new event
3. **PUT** `/api/events/:id` - Update existing event
4. **DELETE** `/api/events/:id` - Delete event

### Files Modified/Created

- `backend/server.js` - Added event endpoints
- `backend/database.sql` - Updated schema with description field
- `backend/migrate_events.sql` - Migration script for existing databases
- `backend/test_events.js` - Test script for API endpoints
- `backend/README_EVENTS.md` - Setup and usage guide

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation
